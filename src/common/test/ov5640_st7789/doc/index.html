<h1>Overview</h1>
<br>


<p> eGFX is a graphics library written in C targeted for embedded microcontrollers. Think of it as the last stop before you may use a much more complex color display, 
linux/android system.   It has found its way into system with monochrome OLEDs, sharp memory LCDs, etc.   Its humble beginnings was some routines to draw onto a 48x24 LED matrix display 
using an MSP430 microcontroller.  The architecture is uses a loose coupling between various functionality so it is easy to hack and adapter.  

Over time, eGFX was extended to include some useful tools to make embedded UIs a bit easier to manage.

<code class="c++">

void main()
{
	eGFX_Dump(&BackBuffer);
}

<p>
 The library can be evaluated/test without having any embedded system.
 An easy to hack windows program is included that simulated a 256x64 pixel display.
 You can call the graphics functions just as you would in your embedded system. 
 This framework is what is used to test and develop the library.


<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Most Datatypes are passed as 16-bit and 32-bit variables. Unless these is a good design reason, 
    almost all new state variables, etc are 32-bit. This is the result of a transition to low cost 32-bit MCU's (Such as Cortex-M).
 There is no reason to design/optimize for an 8/16-bit system.
 
<br>
<li>The Graphics rendering system is loosely coupled to hardware. 
In fact, there are many cases where you want to draw to an 2d image to a buffer 
for other purposes. Maybe something crazy like creating a 2d image that will be 
used to generate audio.. This makes writing drivers very easy but optimzation can be a bit more difficult.

<li>While the fundamental data type eGFX_PixelState is 32-bit,
The initial applications were for monochrome displays,  some simple color displays have been implement.  The 32-bit pixel state covers most use cases.

<li>Since the Graphics Driver is loosely coupled to the graphics rendering,
 Any color is mapped at the driver level. I.E. certain bits in the pixel are for red,
 green and blue. This is totally dependent on the driver.

<li>Sprite based assets are stored in FLASH as const structures.
 The library includes some easy to use tools for making sprites. 
 Some microcontrollers have a SPIFI interface which memory maps the 
 flash into the address space of the MCU. This is useful for very large 
 assets. in theory one could load images from an external source such as an SD card but it is not supported in a clean fashion by the library. 
 This often means that you need dynamic memory and possibly a large amount of it external to the chip. 
 Right now, this functionality is not withing the scope of this library. 
 Chances are once you need this capability you should be using a higher-end embedded system.

<li>Fonts are just collections for sprites with some additional data 
in a struct for some rendering hints. There is a 5x7 and 3x5 font included.
 There is also a tool that can generate a font from any installed windows 
 true type font. The font builder can make a custom font from a folder of .png assets.
